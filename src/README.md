Purpose:
	A quick-to-use, bare-bones utility for local data entry and management, in the specific context as a dell repair technician working under Ivy Technologies. After direct experience in the field, it was found that having a readily available listing of everything completed for the day and week was indispensible. On any given day, recieving several requests to find a device, or to reference what work was done on a device, is not uncommon. With the user only being at one station, this utility allows for immediate access to all the details necessary, without needing to manually create and format the documents, or to login to an online inventory tool which was found to be comparatively slower of a process.


Features:
-Error handling for user input and file reading/writing.
-Hotkeys and hotstrings for accessing files and their data, as well as minor interactions with other apps used in the job role.
-Basic archiving, for 7 days, of work completed and details related.


Standard Process:
1 - Sign in.
2 - Select "Rework."
3 - Check parts to be replaced/added.
4 - Add Service tag and DPS number.
5 - Scan part number(s).
6 - Scan new part PPID(s).
7 - Scan old part PPID(s).
8 - Select "Add Entry" and proceed when completed.
9 - Use "ctrl+alt+o" to access the day's report for reference.
10 - Use "ctrl+alt+s" to close references and start the process from step 1.


Side notes:
-The entire utility can be efficiently navigated with only the keyboard, with special utility hotkeys for further encouraging keyboard exclusivity.
-It is assumed that a barcode scanner is in use within the process. However, manual entries work just as well.
